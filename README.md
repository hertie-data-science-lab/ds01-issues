## How to file a good issue

1. **Click "New Issue"** and choose the appropriate template
2. **Fill in required fields** — especially your Hertie email so we can follow up
3. **Paste terminal output** — use code blocks:

   ````
   ```
   paste your error message or terminal output here
   ```
   ````

   This makes it much easier to read, search, and debug.
